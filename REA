An Molecular dynamics simulation code written julia.

Capabilities:
- Initiaze geometry as a grid in 3D
- Optimize geometries using dampened velocity verlet 
- Perform MD simulations for any user defined interatomic potential
- Outputs VMD comaptible files for vizualization

Limitations:
- Current implementations assumes all particles are identical 
- No explicit way to grab a forcce field, as of now
